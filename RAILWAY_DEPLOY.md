- `RAILWAY_STATIC_URL`

### Key Features

âœ… **Auto Database Detection**: Automatically uses MySQL when available, falls back to SQLite
âœ… **Asset Building**: Frontend assets are built during deployment
âœ… **Smart Database Seeding**: Only seeds database if empty (prevents duplicate data)
âœ… **Production Optimized**: Caching and optimization enabled
âœ… **Session Management**: Database-based sessions for scaling
âœ… **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health check endpoint
âœ… **HTTPS Ready**: Automatic HTTPS configuration for production

### Troubleshooting

**Database Connection Issues:**
- Ensure MySQL service is added to your Railway project
- Check that environment variables are properly injected
- Visit `/health` endpoint to check database status

**Build Failures:**
- Check Railway build logs
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in composer.json and package.json
- Verify PHP version compatibility (requires PHP 8.2+)

**Storage Issues:**
- The app automatically creates storage links during deployment
- File uploads are handled via Laravel's storage system

**Session Problems:**
- Sessions are stored in database for better scalability
- Clear browser cookies if experiencing session issues

### Local Development

   ```bash
   composer install
   npm install
